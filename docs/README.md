# React Boilerplate CRA Template

## What is React Boilerplate CRA Template

{% hint style="info" %}

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **TL;DR:** **`CRA`** handles the bootstrapping and **`React Boilerplate`** gets you started with the best tools and practices.

{% endhint %}

This is a custom [`create-react-app`] template of [`react-boilerplate`]. React Boilerplate has been developing the ultimate React starter kit for many years now. On the other hand **`CRA`** (`create-react-app`) is currently the people's favorite choice. This template has been created to join their strengths together. **`CRA`** provides the necessary bootstrapping to start your projects but does not provide a guide on how to build it. That is where **`react-boilerplate`** comes in and prepares the bases with the battle-tested techniques and tools to guide you into creating state-of-the-art web applications.

{% hint style="warning" %}

This documentation assumes that you are familiar with the [`create-react-app`]. The template is built on top of it. ;)
