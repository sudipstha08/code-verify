# Setting Up Your Editor

You can edit React Boilerplate using any editor or IDE, but there are a few extra steps that you can take to make sure your coding experience is as good as it can be.

## VS Code

We provide a `.vscode` folder out-of-the-box which includes the **recommended extensions**, **debugger configuration**, and **settings**

They are highly suggested for the best Developer Experience. Extensions are responsible for:

- Eslint
- Prettier
- Chrome debugger
- Jest
- Styled Components

These are the basic building blocks in the boilerplate.

## Chrome Extensions

For a better debugging and development experience we suggest [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en). In the boilerplate, Redux is configured with this extension in mind so that you can debug and monitor your state changes very easily.
