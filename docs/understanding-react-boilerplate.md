# Understanding `react-boilerplate`

This document is intended to give you a taste of how **`react-boilerplate`** works. It still assumes basic knowledge of React, Redux, and `react-router`. **If you're completely new to React, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead!**

This is a production-ready boilerplate, not for beginners. It includes tools to help you manage performance, asynchrony, styling, everything you need to build a **real** application. Before you get your hands dirty with the source code, we'd like you to go through a checklist that will help you determine whether or not you're ready to use this boilerplate. It's not because we're _holier-than-thou_, but rather because we genuinely want to save you the frustration.

## Tech Stack

Here's a curated list of packages that you should be at least familiar with before starting your awesome project. However, the best way to see a complete list of the dependencies is to check **`package.json`**.

### Core

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)

- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [React-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next)

### Unit Testing

## Code/Folder Structure

Let's start with understanding why we have chosen our particular structure. It has been an [evolving discussion](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/issues/27), and if you have an afternoon or two we recommend you read the full thread.

In any case, here's the TL;DR:

- You will write your app in the **`src/app`** folder. This is the folder you will spend most, if not all, of your time in.
- Configuration, generators, and templates are in the **`internals`** folder.

### `src/app`

**FOLDER STRUCTURE HERE IS COMPLETELY DETERMINED BY YOU!**

There have been many discussions on how the components and everything else should be structured. Yet, one size never fits all. Therefore, it is entirely personal. This boilerplate dictates **NO** folder structures. Example application provides a simple structure for a simple web application.

### `src/`

Here is the rest of the code that supports your app behind-the-scenes, with features like creating a Redux store, translations, styles & themes, and your Redux state types (or any custom typings)...

### `internals/`

This section you won't be bothering with much. We ship some extra functionalities to help with your web app and here it lies. It contains the code for:

- `internals/extractMessages`: Utils to extract messages into JSON syntax.

- `internals/generators`: Create new components and redux-toolkit slices using CLI.

- `internals/testing`: Testing the internal features like `generators`. You can customize your generators and still test them if they are working
