# Redux-Saga

`redux-saga` is a library to manage side-effects in your application. It works beautifully for data fetching, concurrent computations and a lot more. [Sebastien Lorber](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber) put it best:

> Imagine there is widget1 and widget2. When some button on widget1 is clicked, then it should have an effect on widget2. Instead of coupling the 2 widgets together (i.e. widget1 dispatches an action that targets widget2), widget1 only dispatches that its button was clicked. Then the saga listens for this button click and updates widget2 by dispatching a new event that widget2 is aware of.
>
> This adds a level of indirection that is unnecessary for simple apps, but makes it easier to scale complex applications. You can now publish widget1 and widget2 to different npm repositories so that they never have to know about each other, without having them share a global registry of actions. The 2 widgets are now bounded by contexts that can live separately. They don't need each other to be consistent and can be reused in other apps as well. **The saga is the coupling point between the two widgets that coordinate them in a meaningful way for your business.**

To learn more about this amazing way to handle concurrent flows, start with the [official documentation](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga) and explore some examples! (Read [this comparison](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34930735/pros-cons-of-using-redux-saga-with-es6-generators-vs-redux-thunk-with-es7-async/34933395) if you're used to `redux-thunk`.)

## Usage

Sagas are associated with a slice. If your slice already has a `saga.ts` file, simply add your saga to that. If your slice does not yet have a `saga.ts` file, add one with this boilerplate structure:

#### `.../slice/saga.ts`

```ts
import { takeLatest, call, put, select } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import { homepageActions } from '.';

// Root saga
export default function* homepageSaga() {
  // if necessary, start multiple sagas at once with `all`
  yield [
    takeLatest(actions.someAction.type, getSomething),
    takeLatest(actions.someOtherAction.type, getOtherThing),
  ];
}
```

### Using your saga in components

Once you have a saga in your slice, [`useInjectSaga`](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/redux-injectors/blob/master/docs/api.md#useinjectsaga) from `redux-injectors` will inject the root saga.

#### `.../slice/index.ts`

```ts
// ... code from above

export const useHomepageSlice = () => {
  useInjectReducer({ key: slice.name, reducer: slice.reducer });
  useInjectSaga({ key: sliceKey, saga: homepageSaga });
  return { actions: slice.actions };
};
```

A `mode` argument can be one of three constants (import the enum `SagaInjectionModes` from `redux-injectors`):

- `DAEMON` (default value) â€” starts a saga when a component is being mounted and never cancels it or starts again;
- `RESTART_ON_REMOUNT` â€” starts a saga when a component is being mounted
  and cancels with `task.cancel()` on component un-mount for improved performance;
- `ONCE_TILL_UNMOUNT` â€” behaves like `RESTART_ON_REMOUNT` but never runs the saga again.

ðŸŽ‰ **Good News:** You don't need to write this boilerplate code by hand, the `slice` generator will generate it for you. âœ“
